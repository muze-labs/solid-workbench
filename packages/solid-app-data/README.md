# Solid Apps data composition

Experimental application integration package. This is the suite's composition
of published Solid libraries, not a new persistence framework.

`capabilities.mjs` exposes renderer-independent `ManagedApp`, `PortConnection`
and the browse capability contract. `ManagedApp` connects to its Launcher opener,
registers capabilities, publishes `getState()` native Turtle with an optional app-owned opaque string and calls `restoreState(state)`.
Providers receive `onRequest(event)`, answer with `respond(event.id, { result })`
or `{ error: { code, message } }`, and clear selection UI through `onCancel`.
Validate returned URLs with `selectionUrl`. Calls have cancellation, timeout and
disconnect handling; invocations are not replayed on reconnect. A new client
registers with `restoring: true`, then publishes state and sends `ready` after
restoration. `restore-error` reports setup failure. Closed-port resumes explicitly
request reconnection; same-instance reconnection reuses live state/restoration
rather than resetting UI drafts. Stale channel tasks cannot publish into a new
channel. Launcher checkpoints ready apps with a ten-second deadline, reports
failures per app and never closes apps using a silently substituted cached state.

`workspace-broker.mjs` owns browser windows, instance identity, private ports and
explicit route policy. `whenReady(id, { signal, timeout })` waits for a verified
ready instance and reports cancellation, blocked/closed windows and setup errors.
Configured capabilities use `beginEmbedded`, `requestEmbedded` and `endEmbedded`
with owner-scoped tickets; ordinary managed windows are not a live picker pool.
The obsolete `request`, `allow` and Launcher `chooseFiles` APIs are removed.
`PortConnection.close()` sends a disconnect frame before local settlement.
Malformed envelopes close the connection; structured-clone payloads retain
capability-specific validation. The presenter detects iframe navigation and
changed provider generations and offers explicit recovery without replay.
Native state and selected descriptions have no inherited 64 KiB cap. Unknown
RDF, including retired instance grants, remains preserved and uninterpreted.
`workspace-state.mjs` uses the published Solid Workspace
IndexedDB source for local state and native RDF for conditional Pod checkpoints.
A successful workspace PUT can omit its ETag. That checkpoint stays acknowledged;
its old validator is discarded. A later explicit write refreshes the native
resource/validator, comparing its snapshot with the target-scoped acknowledged
baseline to distinguish pending local edits from concurrent remote edits.
Validator refresh for a write preserves the caller's snapshot rather than
silently adopting a different remote workspace. Closure requires an already
prepared valid conditional body. Live updates do not write the Pod. `reviewConflict(session, url)` loads the
current native Pod document; `resolveConflict(session, url, 'local' | 'pod')`
requires that review. Keeping local prepares a conditional save against the
reviewed ETag; using Pod changes the local snapshot without a PUT. A subsequent
412 revokes the review. Remote preparation errors do not poison local updates. Credentials and reconnect keys are excluded
from public snapshots. See the [workspace guide](../../broker/README.md) and
[design](../../design/solid-managed-workspace.md). These are experimental suite
interfaces; capability routing grants no Solid authorization.

- Root export: native `oldm` context with the Turtle backend, shared vocabulary
  prefixes, URI helpers, conditional `loadDocument`/`copyDocument`/`saveDocument`,
  and `connectSession` for WebID discovery and the Metro authentication lifecycle.
- `collection.mjs`: `openCollection(name, options)` opens an IndexedDB-backed
  SimplySolid resource. `connect(session, url)` connects and synchronizes it.
  The returned `collection` is the published library API, not a second model.
- `link-metadata.mjs`: discovers the parent container description from HTTP Link
  headers and writes conditional `lm:deleted` metadata. It never physically
  deletes resource bytes. Missing descriptions and conflicts are failures.
- `launch.mjs`: validates and reads launch fragments, and builds application
  URLs carrying the current WebID and a full resource URL. Nested resource
  fragments survive. `parseLaunchUrl()` also returns the remaining URL for the
  optional `#app-fragment?parameters` form; `%3F` is not a separator. The codec
  is pure; receivers apply any address cleanup. URL context grants no authority.
  Pass `parameterLocation: 'query'` to the builder context or reader options
  for explicit server-side query support; the default remains `fragment`.
  Omit `webId` for anonymous generation. Reserved WebIDs are removed from both
  locations; `resource` is emitted only if supplied.
  See the suite's
  `design/solid-app-launch-context.md` contract for independent consumers.

`saveDocument` rejects existing documents without an ETag and uses If-Match;
new documents use If-None-Match. It returns the new ETag when supplied; callers
must reload before another edit when that response omits its validator. A failed write does not
imply rollback of a server-side change; reload before retrying an uncertain result.

`session.perform(operation, { interactive })` owns the authentication popup for
an operation, closing it afterward. Interactive operations must start from a
user gesture. Background operations pass `interactive:false` and never open one.
See the suite README for known scope and manual sign-in verification still needed.

`session.logout()` disables that session/client, closes its reserved popup and
clears the account's OAuth2/ID-token values through Metro's public stores. It
preserves issuer discovery/client registration, other accounts and user data.
This bridge uses the issuer + WebID scope of the published Metro-OIDC version.
It does not revoke tokens or end the provider's own login session. The owning UI
removes its remembered WebID and reloads to discard connected resource handles.
