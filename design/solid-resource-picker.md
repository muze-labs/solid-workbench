# Resource picker and initial broker

Experimental suite contract, 2026-11-01. Continues broker Phases 0 and 1.

## Capability semantics

`https://vocab.muze.nl/capabilities/browse` requests one file or container URL.
Input is an empty JSON-LD node with context
`{"@vocab":"https://vocab.muze.nl/capability#"}`. A result is a JSON-LD node
`{"@id":"https://pod.example/resource"}`. The complete HTTP(S) URI is returned,
including its query/fragment when supplied by a provider. No bytes are moved,
downloaded or written. A URI grants no access. Files selects among resources
actually listed by its authorized Solid session, within its configured root.
The caller validates the result before replacing its field.

The companion recipient pilot is
`https://vocab.muze.nl/capabilities/select-recipient`: one explicit selection
returns an `@id` identifying the selected WebID or contact, not implied access
rights or a mailbox address. Its implementation, shape filters and registry
remain deferred. Both URIs are provisional and not asserted to dereference yet.

## Managed transport and authority

The server relay described in the original version of this document is
superseded by the [browser-local workspace design](solid-managed-workspace.md).
The capability semantics above remain current. Launcher opens an instance,
checks its origin/window, and offers a private MessagePort. Only explicitly
allowed providers receive selection requests. Files uses its own Solid session;
a WebID in a launch URL establishes neither routing nor Pod authorization.

`PortConnection` frames calls, replies and cancellation with unique request IDs.
Pending/outstanding work is bounded, requests expire, and disconnect rejects
pending work. A busy Files UI refuses another request instead of replacing the
selection the user is considering. Capability invocations are not replayed on
reconnect. Multiple allowed live providers produce an ambiguity error.

Launcher validates a returned HTTP(S) URL before changing its resource draft.
Cancellation preserves the previous field. Files owns picker UI, selection and
its existing data policy. SimplyFlow renders content; no second renderer is
introduced. Test cross-origin routing, cancellation, provider loss, denied reads,
source/origin/instance checks and per-instance grants. The browser proof uses
fixture data; see [setup and evidence limits](../broker/README.md).


## One-click Launcher activation

The same cycle now focuses an eligible existing Files instance or opens/reuses
the built-in Files app when absent. This is bounded built-in startup, not the
future provider registry. Opening/focus starts in the user's click; readiness
waiting is cancellable and bound to the selected instance. Grants are checked
again before invocation, and ambiguity is visible. Selection/cancellation asks
for focus back to Launcher, with manual-switch guidance when browser policy
refuses. The isolated protocol/browser proof avoids workspace persistence while
DEF18's native RDF correction remains open.


## Preferred provider, CYC118

CYC118 adds identity-wide resource-picker choice in shared Preferences, with a
capable saved-app list and custom app URL entry. See
[the native preference contract](../packages/solid-preferences/README.md#preferred-resource-picker).
This continues broker Phase 2; recipient selection and independently implemented
broker replaceability remain separate Phase 3 work. Selection grants no Pod
permission. The current UI uses the existing transient embedded task with tab
fallback; the older top-level activation helper remains available.

Saved app declarations are optional and explicit. The current Launcher supplies
its saved-app metadata and verified live declarations through the existing
private Preferences operation; the editor reads linked manifests through Metro.
There is no app catalog, guessed manifest discovery or automatic startup merely
to inspect support. Failed provider startup keeps the chosen provider and caller
draft. Provider changes affect subsequent calls; exact ticket-time checks reject
a stale choice, and workspace teardown prevents a late result entering a new
workspace. URL identity and executable location remain distinct native terms.

The schema and vocabulary remain experimental. These are implementation
contracts for review, not a claim of third-party certification or human cycle
acceptance.
